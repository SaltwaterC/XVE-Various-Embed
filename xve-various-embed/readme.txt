XVE (XVE Various Embed) is a simple yet powerful way to add media content to your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

XVE (XVE Various Embed) is a simple yet powerful way to add media content to your WordPress blog. It is a drop-in replacement for my old XHTML Video Embed plug-in, while it aims to continue the original support.

The plug-in is self documented, so there's the point where you may want to start. The help is integrated into the WordPress help system. If you're looking for it, it's into the above menu, the 'Help' item. For some of you, this isn't so obvious as the Help system is kinda new.

Supported video services: youtube.com (youtu.be URLs as well), metacafe.com, dailymotion.com, revver.com, spike.com, vimeo.com, livestream.com, capped.tv, trilulilu.ro, 220.ro, collegehumor.com, myvideo.de, snotr.com, gametrailers.com

Supported audio services: trilulilu.ro, 220.ro

Supported image services: trilulilu.ro

It also supports generic SWF / FLV (MP4) embedding.

For the FLV (MP4) embedding, there are three provided players: Flowplayer, FLV Player, and JW Player. You may change them on the fly without the need to change the embed code.

== Installation ==

1. Add the xve-various-embed directory to /wp-content/plugins.
1. Enable it via the WordPress administration interface.
1. Start using it :).

== Changelog ==

- 1.0.2 - adds support for YouTube modest branding (aka the player without the YouTube logo)
- 1.0.1 - fixes the Trilulilu embeds as the service changed the syntax without maintaining full backward compatibility
- 1.0 - plug-in rewrite from scratch
