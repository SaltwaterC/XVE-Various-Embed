XVE (XVE Various Embed) is a WordPress plug-in for embedding media content to your blog. It is a drop-in replacement for my old plug-in XHTML Video Embed ( http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xhtml-video-embed/ ), that was mostly a hack that grew from 50 lines of code to the mess which is today. It still works, but it is quite unmaintainable.

For more details, go to the wordpress.org page of the plug-in: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xve-various-embed/ . This GitHub page is just for the actual development process, while the plug-in hosting is on wordpress.org due to better discovery support as well as the WordPress installation integration with their plug-in hosting. As consequence, only the stable versions go there.
