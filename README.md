XVE (XVE Various Embed) is a WordPress plug-in for embedding media content to your blog. It is a drop-in replacement for my old plug-in [XHTML Video Embed](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xhtml-video-embed/).

For more details, go to the [wordpress.org page of the plug-in](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xve-various-embed/). This GitHub page is just for the actual development process, while the plug-in hosting is on wordpress.org due to better discovery support as well as the WordPress installation integration with their plug-in hosting. As consequence, only the stable versions go there.
