v1.0 RC2
=======
 - Take care of the localisation support.

v1.0 GA
=======
 - Announce the existence of the new plug-in into the old XHTML Video Embed
 wordpress.org page.

v1.1
====
 - Research the possibility to add oEmbed (http://www.oembed.com/) support.
 Since this is an anti-pattern (reliance onto an external API) this will be used
 for the services that don't provide an URL-to-embed structure. Response caching
 ought to be used.

 - Benchmark the WP Shortcode API (http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API). If
 it's faster than hand crafted RegExp, then XVE will follow the upstream path.
 Currently the legacy support stays in the way as it complicates things too
 much to have WordPress manage this critical piece of functionality. Notice: the
 v1.0 hand crafted regex implementation is not the fastest, but the shortest for
 the XVE needs. Some speed hacks up the sleeve are still there.
 
 - Research the possibility to implement Embed.ly (http://api.embed.ly/) for
 adding more functionality.
