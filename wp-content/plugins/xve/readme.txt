XVE (XVE Various Embed) is a simple yet powerful way to add media content to your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

XVE (XVE Various Embed) is a simple yet powerful way to add media content to your WordPress blog. It is a drop-in replacement for my old XHTML Video Embed plug-in, while it aims to continue the original support.

The plug-in is self documented, so there's the point where you may want to start. The help is integrated into the WordPress help system. If you're looking for it, it's into the above menu, the 'Help' item. For some of you, this isn't so obvious as the Help system is kinda new.

== Installation ==

1. Add the xve-various-embed directory to /wp-content/plugins.
1. Enable it via the WordPress administration interface.
1. Start using it :).
